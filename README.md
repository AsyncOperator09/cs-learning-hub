# CS Learning Hub

This repository is the navigation and architecture layer for my Computer Science learning portfolio.

I’ve been a self-taught programmer for 10+ years. I’m pursuing a CS degree to formalize and deepen fundamentals (algorithms, data structures, OOP design, and performance tradeoffs) and to document that growth in a way that’s useful to engineers and hiring teams.

## How this portfolio is organized

This portfolio is **concept-driven**, not assignment-driven.

### What you’ll see in the course repos
- Topic pages written in plain language (concept → mental model → pitfalls → tradeoffs)
- Real-world mapping (where the concept shows up in production systems)
- Reflection notes (what changed in my understanding and how I improved)
- Lightweight “artifact summaries” (what an assignment tested, without publishing graded solutions)

### What you won’t see
- Graded homework/lab solutions or copied submissions
- Instructor materials or anything that would violate academic integrity policies :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0} :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

The intent is to demonstrate understanding and growth while staying academically honest.

## Concept progression map

This is the conceptual path I’m building and documenting:

1. **Programming Fundamentals**
   - Syntax, variables, operators
   - Conditionals and loops
   - Functions and decomposition
   - Arrays and basic algorithms

2. **Structured Problem Solving**
   - Turning requirements into algorithms
   - Translating algorithms into code
   - Identifying edge cases and constraints

3. **Object-Oriented Thinking**
   - Classes, encapsulation, and information hiding
   - Designing boundaries and responsibilities
   - Modeling real systems with objects

4. **Data Structures & Performance**
   - Arrays vs. linked structures
   - Searching and sorting tradeoffs
   - Memory and reference reasoning

5. **Input/Output and Real Data**
   - Console I/O, file I/O, and data handling patterns
   - Building systems that deal with imperfect inputs

## How to use this repo

If you’re reviewing quickly:
1. Start with the **Java Foundations** repo (C155) if you want fundamentals.
2. Start with **OOP + Data Structures** (C201) if you want design + structure thinking.
3. Check **Metrics & Outcomes** if you want performance trends and learning approach.

If you’re reviewing deeply:
- Follow the concept progression above and read the topic pages in order.
